# Welcome to qrstat!

## 🙋‍♀️ Introduction
qrstat is a lightweight, no-friction app for creating quick polls - where the answers come in the form of two QR codes: yes or no.
Whether you’re gathering feedback in the office, at an event, or on a coffee shop counter, qrstat makes it effortless and engaging.


## 📊 How It Works
1. Write your question (e.g., “Did you enjoy the service?”)
